regression:	problems with a quantitative response
classification:	problems with a qualitative (or categorical) response
quantitative variable:	takes on a numerical value (e.g. age, height, income)
qualitative variable: takes on a value of one of K different classes or categories
bias: error introduced by approximating a complicated model by a simpler one
variance: the amount our prediction changes from one training set to another
parametric model: assumes a specific form of relationship
non-parametric model: does not assume a specific form of relationship
training dataset: set of data used to estimate f
test dataset: hold out set used to estimate model performance
error:  difference in observed response compared to predicted response
MSE:  one measure of measuring model error; mean squared error
interpretability: ability to make specific inference in regard to data and model
flexibility:  ability for model to fit the data
